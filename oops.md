Detailed Explanation of OOP Concepts:
1. Encapsulation:
Private Fields: The #id, #name, #price, and #stock fields in the Product class are private and cannot be directly accessed from outside. The data is only manipulated via getter methods (e.g., getName(), getPrice()) and setter methods (e.g., reduceStock()).

Shopping Cart: The cart items are stored in the private cartItems array and can only be accessed through public methods like addItem(), removeItem(), and displayCart().

2. Abstraction:
Simplifying Complex Processes: Methods like addItem(), removeItem(), and checkout() in the ShoppingCart class hide the complex logic of adding/removing items and checking out, exposing only the necessary functionality to the user.

Order Processing: The processOrder() method in the Order class abstracts the complexity of processing an order, reducing it to a simple call that checks out the cart and reduces the stock.

3. Inheritance:
The DigitalProduct class inherits from the Product class using the extends keyword. This allows DigitalProduct to use the methods of Product (e.g., getDescription(), getPrice()) while also adding new features like download() and a more specific version of getDescription().
4. Polymorphism:
Method Overriding: Both the Dog and Cat classes in the previous example and DigitalProduct in this case demonstrate polymorphism by overriding methods from the parent class (getDescription() in Product).

Different Behaviors for the Same Method: In the DigitalProduct class, the getDescription() method is overridden to include the file size, while Product just returns basic information. This is polymorphism because the same method behaves differently based on the object type.

5. Classes:
We use classes like Product, ShoppingCart, Order, and User to define blueprints for our objects. Each class is responsible for encapsulating related behavior, such as managing products, handling the shopping cart, and processing orders.
Summary of Concepts Demonstrated:
Encapsulation: Hiding data and providing controlled access via getter/setter methods.
Abstraction: Simplifying complex operations (like order processing and cart management) into easy-to-use methods.
Inheritance: The DigitalProduct class inherits from Product, gaining its properties and methods, and extending them.
Polymorphism: Overriding methods (like getDescription) to give them different behavior in subclasses.
Classes: Defining blueprints for creating and managing objects like Product, ShoppingCart, Order, and User.
This basic structure can be expanded further in a real e-commerce application, adding features like user authentication, payment processing, and product reviews, but this gives you a solid foundation for understanding and implementing OOP concepts in a JavaScript-based e-commerce site.
